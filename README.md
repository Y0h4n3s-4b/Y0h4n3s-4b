Yo, I’m Yohanes
Welcome to my chaotic corner of GitHub, where code meets cocaine i mean caffeine, and cybersecurity meets "why is my terminal yelling at me again?" I’m just a random student who’s way too obsessed with firewalls, phishing scams, and pretending I know what I’m doing. Spoiler: I’m still learning, and half my commits are just me fixing my own disasters.
About Me
Cybersecurity Enthusiast: I dream of hacking the planet, but for now, I’m just trying not to lock myself out of my own Wi-Fi.

Student: Majoring in “How to Google Error Codes” with a minor in “Procrastination via Reddit.”

Vibe: Part geek, part chaos agent, 100% “I’ll figure it out eventually.”

What’s Here?
A glorious mess of projects, half-baked scripts, and maybe something useful if you squint hard enough. Expect some cybersecurity experiments, random tools, and a lot of “oops, forgot to make them public :).”
Wanna Stalk Me?
Good luck, fam! I’ve got social media scattered across the internet like a digital Easter egg hunt. Flex your OSINT skills and track me down—consider it a free training exercise. (Pro tip: I’m not that good at hiding… yet.)
